"# WHAT IS SKY ? "

SKY is a yet incomplete interpreted programming language that has a simple syntax and as we hope a good performance.
Currently, this is version 0.0 which means that it's going to be so slow even slower than Python [obviously, it's built-in top of it :) ]
but as the language develops it gets faster [ after we change to the C++ interpreter ]

"# WHY SKY ?"

Well it gives easy though strong experiences and the ultimate goal of it is to get to nearly the speed of C++ (a compiled version of SKY)

"# IT'S USE CASES:"

- Used mostly in ai and machine learning
- Can be used to develop games although it would be way easier than making a 2d game with other libs
- Perhaps would be able to make a graphical user interface (GUI)
- and obviously, you'll be able to implement algorithms like any other programing language
